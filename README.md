# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Node.js Asynchronous Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows code that doesn't properly handle errors within a Promise, leading to potential crashes and unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling. 

## Problem

Asynchronous operations are fundamental to Node.js.  If an asynchronous operation fails and the error isn't caught, Node.js might produce an 'unhandled promise rejection' warning (or even crash, depending on the environment). This makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause and makes the application unreliable. 

## Solution

The solution involves using `.catch()` to gracefully handle any errors thrown by the promise. The corrected code logs the error and sends an appropriate response to the client.  Using a `try...catch` block around asynchronous operations may also help prevent unhandled exceptions.
